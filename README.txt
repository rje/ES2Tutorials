This is a series of tutorials where I hope to cover the following:

* How to set up a game to use OpenGLES 2.0
* How to gracefully fall back to OpenGLES 1.1 when 2.0 is not available
* How to do fun stuff with shaders

This is just the code repository, go to http://igamedev.posterous.com/ for the
actual tutorials.

Cheers, and happy hacking!
