Tutorial 1: Getting Started

This first tutorial shows how to draw an asset using either OpenGLES 2.0 or 1.1 
depending on the capabilities of the relevant device.  It should not be relied 
upon for any concept of design, it is intentionally minimal so we can highlight 
the basic portions of having multiple render paths.
